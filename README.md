How to get MongoDb to run.

Install mongoDB

Create a directory on the root of your C: Drive named db "\db"

After the directory is created, run this command below

"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.2\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="c:\db"

this command worked for me using the windows command prompt.

After the path is set, you can use MongoDB Compass Community to delete, create and insert tables in the db folder.
